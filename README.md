# Connect-four-AI
Overview:
This assignment is a simulation for the Connect-four game. The user plays with an AI agent until the board is full. The winner at the end will be having the greater score.
Assumptions and Details: 
The player always plays first and uses the pink-colored piece, while the computer agent uses the blue-colored piece.
The player can make a move by pressing on the right column, and then the computer agent plays automatically.
The player can ask the game for a hint by clicking on the button “Show a Hint”. A yellow-colored piece appears in the suggested position.  
The button “Show State Graph” is used for displaying the graph of the game state at the current time.
The depth of the Minimax algorithm is three by default and can be changed by writing the required depth at a text box that appears beside the label “Depth”.
